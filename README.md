# 🧠 Discord Bot Template (Legacy — discord.py)

This is a legacy starter template for a Discord bot using `discord.py`, built before Discord fully moved to **slash commands (interactions)**.

> ⚠️ **Deprecation Notice**  
> This template likely **does not work as-is anymore** due to Discord's updated bot policy requiring **interactions** (slash commands) for most bot features.  
> Built using prefix commands and traditional event handling, which now have limited support.

## ❓ What’s Inside

- Prefix-based command system (`!ping`, etc.)
- Basic event handling (`on_ready`, `on_message`)
- Modular file structure for commands and events using cogs
